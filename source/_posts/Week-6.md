# Week 6

Tasks Accomplished this week:
- Zhaoyan and Pooja worked on getting Micromachines running, however the game crashes even after reinstalling and researching online for solutions.
- Instead of running the actual game to determine game controls, the game controls were googled
- Kaartik worked on getting motioninput code running on his laptop successfully
- Baixu created a list of gestures supported by motioninput that could be used for Micromachines controls.
